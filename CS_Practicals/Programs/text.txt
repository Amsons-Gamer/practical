Hello, everyone. 
Cyber safety is the practice of protecting our online activities, data, and devices from malicious attacks and threats. 
It is essential for our personal, professional, and social well-being.
Why is cyber safety important? Because we live in a digital world, where we rely on the internet for almost everything.
We use it to communicate, learn, work, shop, play, and more. 
But the internet is also a place where cybercriminals can exploit our vulnerabilities and harm us. 
They can steal our identity, money, or information. They can damage our devices or networks. They can spread misinformation, hate, or violence. 
They can even threaten our national security or democracy.

How can we practice cyber safety? By following some simple but effective tips, such as:
- Use strong and unique passwords for your online accounts and devices. Change them regularly and do not share them with anyone.
- Use a reputable antivirus software and firewall on your devices. Update them frequently and scan your devices regularly.
- Avoid clicking on suspicious links or attachments in emails, messages, or websites. They could contain malware or phishing scams that can compromise your security.
- Be careful about what you share online. Do not post or send anything that you would not want others to see or use against you. Think before you click or type.
- Educate yourself and others about the latest cyber threats and trends. Stay informed and alert. Report any suspicious or illegal activity to the authorities.

What is the future of cyber safety? As technology evolves and becomes more sophisticated, so do the cyber threats and challenges.
We need to keep pace with the changes and innovations, and adapt our cyber safety practices accordingly. 
We also need to collaborate and cooperate with each other, across sectors, countries, and communities, to create a safer and more secure cyberspace for everyone.

In conclusion, cyber safety is not only a matter of convenience, but also a matter of necessity. 
It is our responsibility and duty to protect ourselves and others from the dangers of the online world. 
It is also our opportunity and privilege to enjoy the benefits and opportunities of the digital world. Let us all be cyber smart and cyber safe. Thank you.
